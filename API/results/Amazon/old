This advises customers to make the best buying decisions by bringing third party, expert content into Amazon. Onsite publishing sources high-quality content from third-party publishers and influencers at scale, moderates, annotates, and vends it to internal experience owners within Amazon (e.g. Video Shopping, Storefronts, #FoundItonAmazon, StyleFeed), and monitors content performance. OSP also owns the content publishing tools along with select creator experiences. We believe that providing relevant, quality content across Amazon will increase long-term customer engagement along with product discovery and research.\u003cbr/\u003eThe challenge that OSP owns is unique at Amazon in two ways: 1) OSP owns the end-to-end content workflows from ingestion to vending, and we must build robust Science methods to automate this at Amazon scale, and 2) We are building our workflows in a content agnostic way, but we will need ways to solve multi-content optimization, e.g. publisher articles that include photos and/or videos. and content ranking.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eWe are seeking a Principal Applied Scientist to both tackle our most complex problems and raise the bar for our Science colleagues within Amazon's Customer Engagement organization .

The knowledge we need to ingest are wide ranging in data type coverage, and are from varying external source formats. To accomplish our multi-year challenges, we need the candidate to lead R\u0026amp;D of ML models to ingest content from disparate sources as opposed to requiring creators to submit content in specific, rigid ways which currently stifles ingestion and on-boarding of content at scale today.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eKey job responsibilities\u003cbr/\u003eThis candidate will be the intellectual thought leader for the team, setting the working backwards path for our most complex problems.

The successful candidate will have a proven track record of breaking down and solving complex Science problems. In addition, you have strong business judgement and are an excellent communicator, with proven ability to influence at the most senior levels.
